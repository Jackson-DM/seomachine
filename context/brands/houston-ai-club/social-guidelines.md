- End with invitation to participate or share
- Keep energy high but genuine

### From Blog to Twitter
- Extract the most shareable, relatable moment

## Forbidden Phrases

- "Leverage" (too corporate)
- "Best practices" (too formal)
- "Ecosystem" (say "community")
- "Value proposition" (never)

### Use Carefully
- "Networking" (can feel transactional - prefer "connect" or "meet")
- "Professional development" (prefer "grow" or "level up")

## Required Elements

### Every Post Must Include
- Genuine warmth and energy
- Inclusive language (all levels welcome vibes)
- Specific detail (names, numbers, moments)
- Houston connection when relevant

### Every Post Should Avoid
- Gatekeeping language
- Jargon without explanation

- Self-promotion over member value
- Excluding beginners

## Variant Differentiation

When generating multiple variants for the same platform:

**Variant 1**: Lead with community story, celebratory tone
**Variant 2**: Lead with relatable struggle, supportive tone
**Variant 3**: Lead with Houston angle or specific learning, curious tone

Each variant should feel like a different side of the community's personality.

- [ ] Would make a newcomer feel welcome
- [ ] Contains specific, engaging detail
- [ ] Uses "we" and "together" language
- [ ] Respects platform character limits
- [ ] Hashtags from approved library
- [ ] CTA invites participation, not just consumption
