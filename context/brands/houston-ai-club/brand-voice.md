# Houston AI Club Brand Voice & Messaging

This document defines the Houston AI Club brand voice, tone, and messaging framework. Reference this when writing all content to ensure consistency.

## Brand Voice Pillars

### 1. Welcoming & Inclusive
- **What it means**: Everyone interested in AI belongs here, regardless of skill level or background
- **How it sounds**: Warm, encouraging, never gatekeeping. Like a friend inviting you to join something exciting.
- **Example**: "Whether you're building your first neural network or leading an AI team, there's a seat at the table for you."
- **Avoid**: Elitism, jargon-heavy language that excludes newcomers, assuming prior knowledge without explanation

### 2. Community-First
- **What it means**: We exist to connect and support Houston's AI community, not to sell or promote
- **How it sounds**: Generous, focused on member value, celebrating others' wins
- **Example**: "Last month, three members landed AI roles after connections made at our meetup. That's what this is all about."
- **Avoid**: Self-promotion over community value, treating members as an audience rather than participants

### 3. Curious & Learning-Oriented
- **What it means**: We're all students of this rapidly evolving field, learning together
- **How it sounds**: Intellectually curious, humble about what we don't know, excited about discovery
- **Example**: "We didn't fully understand multi-modal models until last week's talk. That's why we keep showing up."
- **Avoid**: Pretending to have all the answers, dismissing emerging ideas, being closed to new perspectives

### 4. Houston Proud
- **What it means**: We're building something special in Houston's tech ecosystem
- **How it sounds**: Locally rooted, championing Houston innovation, aware of our city's unique strengths
- **Example**: "From the Energy Corridor to the Medical Center, Houston is quietly becoming an AI powerhouse. Let's make some noise about it."
- **Avoid**: Comparing unfavorably to other tech hubs, ignoring local context, being generic about location

### 5. Practically Minded
- **What it means**: We bridge theory and real-world application—content you can actually use
- **How it sounds**: Applied, hands-on, focused on implementation not just concepts
- **Example**: "Tonight we're not just talking about RAG architectures—we're building one together."
- **Avoid**: Pure theory without application, content that doesn't respect members' time investment

## Tone Guidelines

### General Tone: Enthusiastic Community Builder
Imagine you're the person who started a meetup because you wished it existed. You're genuinely excited to bring people together, you want everyone to feel welcome, and you believe this community can help people grow their careers and skills. You're a connector, not a gatekeeper.

### Tone Variations by Content Type

**Event Announcements**: Excited, clear, welcoming
- "You're going to want to mark your calendar for this one..."
- "Whether you're a first-timer or a regular, this event is for you."
- "Bring your questions—our speakers love the Q&A."
- "Can't wait to see you there."

**Educational Content**: Accessible, encouraging, practical
- "Let's break this down..."
- "Here's what this actually means for your work..."
- "Don't worry if this seems complex at first—it clicked for us too after some practice."
- "The key takeaway is..."

**Community Updates**: Warm, celebratory, grateful
- "Huge congrats to..."
- "We couldn't do this without you all..."
- "Look what our community built..."
- "Thank you to everyone who showed up..."

**Industry News/Trends**: Curious, balanced, locally relevant
- "Here's what this could mean for Houston..."
- "We're seeing some interesting implications for..."

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Sentence Structure
- **Conversational**: Write like you're talking to a friend
- **Active voice**: "We're hosting" not "An event will be hosted"
- **Average length**: 12-18 words per sentence
- **Varied rhythm**: Mix short punchy lines with fuller explanations

### Paragraph Structure
- **Length**: 2-3 sentences typically (shorter for social)
- **One idea per paragraph**: Keep things scannable
- **Transitions**: Natural flow, not forced
- **White space**: Plenty of breathing room

### Word Choice
- **Casual professional**: "Hey" is fine, but stay substantive
- **Inclusive language**: "Everyone", "all of us", "together"
- **Specific over vague**: Name names, cite numbers, give details
- **Energy words**: "Excited", "pumped", "can't wait", "thrilled"

### Terminology

**Say This** → **Not That**
- Member → User (we're a community, not a platform)
- Meetup/event → Session (too corporate)
- Learn → Educate (less stuffy)
- Houston AI community → Houston AI ecosystem (warmer)
- Join us → Register now (more inviting)

## Content Formatting

### Headlines
- **Energetic**: Convey excitement
- **Clear**: What, when, why should I care?
- **Inclusive**: Invite participation
- **Houston references**: When relevant

### Subheadings
- **Scannable**: Capture each section's value
- **Conversational**: Less formal than corporate content
- **Action-oriented**: What will I learn/do?

### Lists
- **Bullet points**: For quick scanning
- **Parallel structure**: Consistent format
- **Limited length**: 3-5 items ideal
- **Substantive**: Each item should add value

### Calls-to-Action
- **Warm invitation**: "Join us" > "Register now"
- **Clear next step**: One obvious action
- **FOMO without manipulation**: Genuine excitement, not pressure
- **Easy friction**: Make it simple to participate

## Voice Examples

### Excellent Houston AI Club Voice

"Last night was one of those meetups that reminds us why we do this.

Fifty people packed into the room for Dr. Chen's talk on LLM fine-tuning—and the Q&A ran 40 minutes over because nobody wanted to leave. We saw three impromptu whiteboard sessions break out afterward.

Shoutout to the folks who drove in from Katy and Clear Lake. Y'all are the real ones.

If you missed it, don't worry—we've got another banger lined up for January. And yes, we're finally doing the hands-on workshop you've been asking for.

More details dropping soon. In the meantime, keep building, keep learning, and keep showing up for each other.

Houston AI is just getting started."

**Why this works**:
- Specific details that paint a picture
- Celebrates community participation
- Acknowledges member effort
- Forward-looking energy
- Local references that resonate
- Conversational and warm

### Not Houston AI Club Voice

"The Houston AI Club is pleased to announce that our recent event on Large Language Model fine-tuning was a success, with 50 attendees participating in the session.

We would like to extend our gratitude to our speaker and to all participants for their engagement. Future events will be announced through our official channels.

For more information about membership opportunities and upcoming programming, please visit our website."

**Why this fails**:
- Formal and corporate
- No personality or energy
- Passive voice throughout
- No specific, engaging details
- Doesn't feel like a community
- Could be any organization
