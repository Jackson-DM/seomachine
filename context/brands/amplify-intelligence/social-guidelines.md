# Amplify Intelligence Social Media Guidelines

Brand-specific social media adaptations for Amplify Intelligence. Use alongside the `/social-content` skill for platform-specific best practices.

## Platform Priorities

1. **LinkedIn** (Primary) - Main channel for thought leadership and business development
2. **Twitter/X** (Secondary) - Industry commentary and real-time engagement
3. **Threads** (Tertiary) - Casual insights, experimental

## Voice Calibration by Platform

### LinkedIn Voice
- **Tone**: Senior consultant sharing hard-won insights
- **Formality**: Professional but not corporate
- **Sentence length**: 15-20 words (full voice expression)
- **Structure**: Story-driven or framework-based posts
- **Engagement style**: Consultative, inviting professional discussion

**Example opener**: "Most AI projects fail before the first model is trained. Here's the question nobody asks early enough:"

### Twitter/X Voice
- **Tone**: Punchy expert sharing sharp insights
- **Formality**: Direct, confident
- **Sentence length**: 8-15 words (compressed)
- **Structure**: Hot takes, quick frameworks, contrarian observations
- **Engagement style**: Provocative but substantive

**Example opener**: "Stop building AI solutions. Start asking better questions."

### Threads Voice
- **Tone**: Slightly more casual expert
- **Formality**: Relaxed professional
- **Structure**: Quick insights, behind-the-scenes observations
- **Engagement style**: Conversational, curious

## Hashtag Library

### Primary Hashtags (use 2-3 per post)
- #AIConsulting
- #EnterpriseAI
- #MLOps
- #AIStrategy

### Topic-Specific Hashtags
**Implementation**: #AIImplementation #DataPipeline #ModelDeployment
**Strategy**: #DigitalTransformation #AIAdoption #TechStrategy
**Leadership**: #AILeadership #CDO #CTO #DataLeadership
**Results**: #AIROI #BusinessIntelligence #DataDriven

### Hashtags to Avoid
- #AI (too generic, no value)
- #MachineLearning alone (too broad)
- Trending hashtags unrelated to content
- More than 5 hashtags total

## CTA Patterns

### Engagement CTAs (preferred)
- "What's your experience with this?"
- "Where have you seen this go wrong?"
- "Agree or disagree?"
- "What would you add?"

### Traffic CTAs (use sparingly)
- "Full framework in the link below"
- "Detailed breakdown on our blog"
- "Link to the case study in comments"

### Save/Share CTAs
- "Bookmark this for your next AI initiative"
- "Share with someone planning an AI project"

## Content Transformation Rules

### From Blog to LinkedIn
- Extract ONE key insight per post
- Lead with the most counterintuitive or valuable point
- Use specific numbers and outcomes when available
- End with a question that invites professional discussion
- Place link in first comment, not in post body

### From Blog to Twitter
- Extract the sharpest, most quotable insight
- Strip to essential message (under 240 chars preferred)
- Use contrarian or provocative framing when authentic
- Thread only if each tweet stands alone
- Save the nuance for LinkedIn

### Hook Formulas for Amplify Intelligence

**Contrarian Consultant**:
"Everyone says [common advice]. Based on [X] implementations, here's what actually works:"

**Pattern Recognition**:
"After [number] AI projects, I've noticed a pattern. The ones that succeed all [share trait]:"

**Hard Truth**:
"[Uncomfortable truth about AI]. Most leaders won't admit this, but:"

**Framework Introduction**:
"Before every AI project, we ask three questions: [question 1], [question 2], [question 3]. Here's why:"

## Forbidden Phrases

### Never Use
- "Leverage cutting-edge AI" (buzzword soup)
- "Best-in-class" (meaningless)
- "Digital transformation journey" (overused)
- "Unlock the power of" (cliche)
- "AI-powered solutions" without specifics
- "Reach out" (use specific CTAs)

### Use Carefully
- "Game-changer" (only with specific evidence)
- "Disruption" (only if truly applicable)
- "Revolutionary" (almost never)

## Required Elements

### Every Post Must Include
- One specific, actionable insight
- Evidence of real expertise (not generic advice)
- Brand voice alignment (consultative, practical, expert)

### Every Post Should Avoid
- Pure self-promotion without value
- Generic advice available anywhere
- Hype without substance
- Jargon without explanation

## Variant Differentiation

When generating multiple variants for the same platform:

**Variant 1**: Lead with primary insight, use story/experience hook
**Variant 2**: Lead with secondary insight, use contrarian/framework hook
**Variant 3**: Lead with data point or specific outcome, use pattern hook

Each variant should feel distinct enough to A/B test.

## Quality Checklist

Before publishing:
- [ ] Sounds like a senior AI consultant, not a marketing team
- [ ] Contains specific, non-obvious insight
- [ ] Uses active voice and direct language
- [ ] Respects platform character limits
- [ ] Hashtags from approved library
- [ ] CTA matches content depth
- [ ] Would a VP/Director of AI find this valuable?
