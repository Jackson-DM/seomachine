## Post 1: The AI Pilot Graveyard

The AI Pilot Graveyard is real.

I've seen it at Fortune 500 companies. Dozens of promising AI pilots that never made it to production.

The pattern is always the same:
- Exciting demo to leadership
- Proof of concept "success"
- Then... nothing

Here's what kills most AI pilots:

1. No clear owner post-pilot
2. Integration complexity underestimated
3. Data quality issues glossed over in POC
4. No plan for model maintenance
5. Success metrics that don't connect to business outcomes

The companies that break through?

They treat the pilot as the START of the work, not the end.

They assign a production owner before the pilot begins.
They budget for integration as much as model development.
They define "what happens when this works" before writing code.

Your AI pilot is impressive.

But can it survive the journey from demo to production?

That's the only question that matters.

## Post 2: The "We Need AI" Conversation

"We need to do something with AI."

I hear this from executives every week.

Here's what I've learned to ask next:

"What decision would you make differently if you had better predictions?"

This one question cuts through the noise.

Because AI, at its core, is prediction.
- Predicting which customers will churn
- Predicting which leads will convert
- Predicting what inventory you'll need
- Predicting which claims are fraudulent

If you can't name a specific decision that would improve with better prediction, you don't need AI.

You need better data hygiene.
Or process improvement.
Or just a dashboard.

Not every problem is an AI problem.

The best AI investments start with a decision that matters, then work backward to the prediction that would help.

What decision in your business would change with better prediction?

## Post 3: The Hidden Cost of AI Models

Nobody talks about the real cost of AI models.

Not compute costs.
Not data labeling.

The cost of keeping them accurate.

We call it model drift, and it's why 60% of ML models degrade within a year.

The world changes.
Customer behavior shifts.
New competitors enter.
Regulations update.

Your model, trained on 2024 data, is making predictions for a 2025 reality.

What this means in practice:

The customer churn model that was 89% accurate at launch?
Six months later: 74%.
A year later: might as well flip a coin.

Smart organizations budget for model maintenance like they budget for software maintenance.

They monitor prediction accuracy in production.
They have retraining triggers defined.
They treat models as living systems, not deployed-and-done projects.

Your model is only as good as its last training run.

When was your last retraining?

## Post 4: Data Quality Reality Check

```
Hot take: 80% of AI project delays are data problems, not model problems.

Every AI project follows the same arc:

Week 1: "This is going to be transformative"
Week 4: "Why is the data in three different formats?"
Week 8: "Who decided customer_id could be null?"
Week 12: "We need to pause and clean the data"

The ML algorithm is rarely the bottleneck.

It's missing values.
It's inconsistent labeling.
It's data silos that don't talk to each other.
It's historical data that doesn't match current schemas.

The unsexy truth about AI success:

Companies with clean, well-governed data move fast.
Companies with data debt move slow, regardless of how good their data science team is.

If you're planning an AI initiative, start here:

1. Can you access the data you need?
2. How complete is it?
3. How consistent is it across systems?
4. Who owns data quality?

Fix data problems first. Model problems are easier.

## Post 5: The Build vs Buy Trap

**Content**:
```
The build vs buy decision in AI is more nuanced than people think.

"We'll build it ourselves" often means:
- 18 months to production (vs. 3 months with a vendor)
- $2M+ in fully-loaded costs
- Ongoing maintenance forever
- Key person risk when your ML lead leaves

"We'll buy a solution" often means:
- Features that don't quite fit your needs
- Data leaving your environment
- Vendor lock-in
- Integration complexity they didn't mention in the demo

The right answer is usually neither pure build nor pure buy.

It's build YOUR differentiators. Buy the commodity.

If AI gives you competitive advantage in your core business, build it.
If AI is operational efficiency that everyone needs, buy it.

Churn prediction for a SaaS company? Probably build.
Invoice processing automation? Probably buy.
Fraud detection for a payments company? Build.
Fraud detection for a retailer? Buy.

The question isn't "can we build this?"

It's "should we build this?"

Where is AI your moat, and where is it table stakes?
