# Content Formats Reference

Platform-specific templates, structures, and best practices for each content type.

## Instagram / TikTok Reel (Short-Form Video)

**Best for:** ICP 1 (primary), ICP 2 (secondary)
**Length:** 30–90 seconds (sweet spot: 45–60s)
**Primary brand:** Houston AI Club, AI-First Work

### Structure Template

```
HOOK (0–3 seconds)
[Scroll-stopping opening line — pull from hook bank]
[Face-to-camera or bold text overlay]

CONTEXT (3–8 seconds)
[One sentence setting up the problem or situation]
"Here's the thing most people don't realize about [topic]..."

CORE CONTENT (8–45 seconds)
[The tip, workflow, or insight — keep to ONE idea]
[Screen recording if demonstrating a workflow]
[Step-by-step if tutorial format]

PAYOFF (45–55 seconds)
[Show the result / outcome / "wow" moment]
"And just like that, you've [achieved X]."

CTA (last 5 seconds)
[Single clear action]
"Follow for more AI workflows like this."
"Save this for later."
"Drop a fire emoji if you want part 2."
```

### Production Notes
- First 3 seconds decide everything — hook must be immediate
- Text overlays for key points (many watch without sound)
- Trending audio optional but can boost reach
- End screen: brand handle + "Follow for more"
- Captions: always on

### Caption Template

```
[Restate or expand on the hook]

[2–3 sentences expanding the value]

[CTA — save, share, comment, or follow]

---
[3–5 hashtags: mix of broad + niche]
#AIforBeginners #AIWorkflow #ChatGPTTips #HoustonAIClub #AIFirstWork
```

## Instagram Carousel (Swipe Post)

**Best for:** ICP 1 (education), ICP 2 (frameworks), ICP 3 (roadmaps)
**Slides:** 7–10 slides optimal
**Primary brand:** All three

### Slide Structure Template

```
SLIDE 1: HOOK SLIDE
[Bold, large text — pull from hook bank]
[Subtext: "Swipe to learn" or "Save this"]
[Branded colors / logo watermark]

SLIDE 2: CONTEXT / PROBLEM
[Set up the pain point or gap]
"Most people [common mistake]..."
"Here's why [topic] matters..."

SLIDES 3–8: CORE CONTENT
[One point per slide — scannable]
[Format options:]
  - Numbered steps (Step 1, Step 2...)
  - Before / After comparisons
  - Myth vs Reality
  - Tool/prompt examples with screenshots
  - Framework diagram

SLIDE 9: SUMMARY / RECAP

```

### Design Notes
- Consistent brand colors and fonts across slides

- One idea per slide — no walls of text
- Use visual hierarchy: headline / supporting text / example
- Watermark or handle on every slide

## LinkedIn Post

**Best for:** ICP 2 (primary), ICP 3 (primary), ICP 1 (secondary)
**Length:** 150–300 words (sweet spot: 200–250 words)
**Primary brand:** AI-First Work, Amplify Intelligence

### Structure Template

```
[HOOK LINE — first line is everything on LinkedIn]
[Must compel the "...see more" click]

[BLANK LINE]

[STORY or CONTEXT — 2–3 short paragraphs]
[Personal experience, observation, or case study]
[Short sentences. Line breaks between thoughts.]
[Create rhythm: statement / elaboration / insight]

[BLANK LINE]

[KEY INSIGHT or FRAMEWORK — the meat]
[This is what people screenshot and share]
[Can be a list (sparingly) or a reframe]

[BLANK LINE]

[CTA or CONVERSATION PROMPT]
"What's your experience with [topic]?"
"Would you add anything to this list?"
"Agree or disagree?"
```

### LinkedIn Best Practices
- First line = hook. If it doesn't compel a click, the post fails.
- Use line breaks aggressively — dense paragraphs die on LinkedIn
- Personal stories outperform abstract advice
- Controversial or contrarian takes get engagement (use responsibly)
- Tag relevant people/companies sparingly
- Post at 7–9 AM or 12–1 PM weekdays
- No hashtags needed (minimal impact on LinkedIn)

### LinkedIn Content Types by ICP

| ICP | Type | Structure |
|-----|------|-----------|
| ICP 2 | Workflow Case Study | "I used to [old way]. Then I [discovered X]. Here's what happened: [results]" |
| ICP 2 | Framework Share | "The [Name] Framework for [task]: [step-by-step breakdown]" |
| ICP 3 | Career Transformation | "6 months ago I was [old role]. Today I [new reality]. Here's what changed:" |
| ICP 3 | Market Opportunity | "Companies are hiring for [role] and most people don't know it exists." |
