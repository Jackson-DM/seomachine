### Demographics
- Age: 24–50 (primary 28–42)
- Income: $40K–$95K
- Roles: Admin Coordinator, Marketing Associate, HR Generalist, Operations Analyst, Project Coordinator, Office Manager, Executive Assistant, Customer Success Rep, Account Manager
- Industries: Professional services, healthcare admin, education, real estate, nonprofit, local government, insurance, retail corporate, hospitality
- Location emphasis: Houston metro; secondary remote US
- Tech: Comfortable with office software, not with code/APIs
- AI experience: Tried ChatGPT 1–5 times, no systematic use

### Psychographic Core
- Sees self as capable but anxious about falling behind
- Does NOT identify as "tech person" — feels AI was built for someone else
- Reads headlines about AI replacing jobs, sees coworkers using it, shuts laptop when trying to learn

### Emotional Triggers → Content Opportunities
| Emotion | Trigger | Content Play |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Intimidation | Technical AI content, coworker discussions | "You don't need to be technical" reassurance |
| FOMO | LinkedIn AI posts, layoff news | "It's not too late" urgency + accessibility |
| Impostor Syndrome | Bad ChatGPT results, assuming personal failure | "It's not you, it's the approach" reframing |
| Cautious Curiosity | Seeing a peer's simple AI win | "Try this one thing" micro-action |
| Relief | Finally understanding a concept or getting a good output | "First win" celebration + next step |

### Pain Points (3 Layers)
**Surface (what they say):** Don't know which tool, get weird answers, don't understand model differences, feel stupid asking, no time
**Root (what they feel):** Fear of irrelevance, shame, analysis paralysis, distrust of own learning ability, frustration with content that assumes knowledge
**Hidden (unarticulated):** Need someone to say they're capable. Need permission to start small. Need community where "dumb questions" are safe.

### Goals by Timeline
- **30 days:** Complete one AI task that saves time, understand ChatGPT vs Claude vs Gemini, write 3–5 reusable prompts, feel confident mentioning AI in a meeting
- **60–90 days:** Integrate AI into 2–3 weekly tasks, build prompt library, know when to use vs not use AI, be seen as "someone who knows AI"
- **6–12 months:** Transition from consumer to creator, get recognized/promoted from efficiency gains, move into ICP 2

### Buying Behavior
- **Discovers via:** Beginner Reels/TikTok, word-of-mouth from Houston AI Club attendees, LinkedIn accessibility posts, Google searches ("how to start learning AI")
- **Converts on:** Free quick-win resources, testimonials from non-technical people, low-risk entry points (free workshops), clear curriculum that won't lose them
- **Top objections:** "Not technical enough" → non-tech success stories | "No time" → 10-min micro-lessons | "Already tried, didn't work" → bad prompts ≠ bad user | "Just ChatGPT tips?" → it's a system, not a tool tutorial | "YouTube is free" → structure + community + accountability

### Content Preferences
- Formats: Short Reels (30–60s), swipe carousels, stories/polls, beginner blog guides, 5-day email drips
- Pillars: Demystification, First Wins, Confidence Building, Guided Paths
- Primary platform alignment: Instagram, TikTok → houstonaiclub.com

### Psychographic Core
- High performer who prides themselves on being ahead of the curve
- Adopted AI early, gets real value sometimes, knows they're at ~20% of potential
- Sees power users online building automation systems, feels the gap
- Doesn't need permission — needs a SYSTEM

### Emotional Triggers → Content Opportunities
| Emotion | Trigger | Content Play |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Frustration | Inconsistent outputs, time fixing AI work | "Here's why your prompts are inconsistent" diagnostic |
| Plateau Anxiety | Stuck at same skill level despite regular use | "The gap between casual and advanced" unlock |
| Competitive Drive | Peers producing faster/better work | "What AI power users do differently" aspirational |
| Optimization Hunger | Knowing there's a better way but not finding it | "Watch me build this workflow in 30 seconds" demo |
| Mastery Desire | Wanting to be the AI expert others consult | "Become the AI expert on your team" authority |

### Pain Points (3 Layers)
**Surface:** Hit-or-miss outputs, using AI tactically not strategically, don't know which prompting techniques matter, spend time editing AI output, can't show boss ROI
**Root:** Wasted potential, false sense of competence, anxiety about peers figuring it out first, no intermediate curriculum exists, content is either too basic or too technical
**Hidden:** Optimizing professional identity and market value. Want to be seen as AI-forward leaders. Need validation that going deeper is correct.

- **Converts on:** Workflow demos that outperform their process, templates to implement immediately, case studies with metrics, cohort learning with high performers, professional-tier pricing
- **Top objections:** "Already know basics" → validate then show advanced gap | "Can learn on my own" → time cost of DIY vs structured frameworks | "Apply to my role?" → industry-specific use cases | "Justify to employer" → ROI calculators + team pricing | "Different from other courses?" → workflow-first, not tool-first

### Content Preferences
- Formats: Long-form YouTube (8–15 min), LinkedIn carousels/posts, screen recordings, weekly newsletter, webinars
- Pillars: Workflow Engineering, Prompting Mastery, Productivity Proof, Tool Orchestration
