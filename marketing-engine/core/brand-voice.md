# Brand Voice Reference

Tone, vocabulary, style rules, and personality per ICP and brand property.

## Voice by ICP

### ICP 1: Curious Beginner Voice

**Personality:** Warm, patient, encouraging friend who happens to be great at AI
**Energy:** Calm confidence, never rushed, never condescending

**Do:**
- Use "Let me show you" instead of "You should know"
- Celebrate small wins loudly — "You just did that!"
- Normalize confusion — "Everyone starts here"
- Use analogies to everyday life (AI is like a really smart intern, prompts are like giving directions)
- Say "try this" not "you need to"
- Acknowledge overwhelm before offering solutions

**Don't:**
- Use acronyms without defining them (LLM, NLP, RAG, API)
- Assume any prior knowledge
- Say "it's easy" or "it's simple" — what's easy for you is new for them
- Use tech-bro language ("ship it," "iterate," "scale")
- Be preachy about AI's importance — they already know, that's why they're here
- Stack multiple concepts in one piece of content

**Vocabulary:**
- "AI tool" not "large language model"
- "Instructions" not "prompts" (initially, then introduce "prompt" as a term)
- "Ask AI to..." not "Engineer a prompt that..."
- "Get better results" not "Optimize outputs"
- "Your first workflow" not "Your first automation pipeline"

**Sentence Rhythm:** Short sentences. One idea at a time. Breathing room between concepts. Use questions to create dialogue: "Ever gotten a weird answer from ChatGPT? Here's why."

### ICP 2: AI-Curious Professional Voice

**Personality:** Sharp, knowledgeable colleague who's two steps ahead — sharing their best system over coffee
**Energy:** Confident, direct, efficient. Respects their time.

**Do:**
- Lead with results and metrics — "This saves me 10 hours/week"
- Show, don't tell — screen recordings, real examples, actual outputs
- Use professional but not academic language
- Be direct — get to the value fast
- Acknowledge their existing skill level — "You already know the basics. Here's what's next."
- Provide frameworks, not just tips

**Don't:**
- Over-explain basics they already know
- Use motivational fluff — they want tactical substance
- Be vague about outcomes — always include specifics
- Talk down to them or treat them like beginners
- Use corporate jargon without substance ("leverage synergies," "paradigm shift")
- Promise magic — they're sophisticated enough to smell BS

**Vocabulary:**
- "Workflow" "framework" "system" "process"
- "Chain-of-thought prompting" "structured output" "multi-step automation"
- "ROI" "time-to-completion" "output quality"
- Use tool names directly: "Claude," "ChatGPT," "Zapier," "Make"
- "Power user" "advanced" "next-level" — aspirational but earned

**Sentence Rhythm:** Punchy, varied. Mix short declarative statements with slightly longer explanations. No filler. "Here's the workflow. Three steps. Each one builds on the last. By the end, you'll have a system you can use every day."

### ICP 3: Career Pivot Builder Voice

**Personality:** Visionary career mentor who's also a strategist — inspirational AND practical
**Energy:** Empowering, forward-looking, honest about the work required

**Do:**
- Paint the vision clearly — what their future looks like
- Back up inspiration with concrete action steps
- Be honest about effort — don't sugarcoat the transition
- Use market language — "positioning," "portfolio," "value proposition"
- Share real numbers — salaries, rates, timelines
- Frame everything as investment in their future self

**Don't:**
- Promise overnight transformation
- Ignore the emotional difficulty of career transitions
- Be so visionary that you forget to be actionable
- Dismiss their current skills — reframe existing experience as an asset
- Use generic "follow your passion" advice
- Neglect the financial/practical realities of career change

**Vocabulary:**
- "Career capital" "portfolio" "positioning" "market demand"
- "Transition plan" "90-day roadmap" "milestones"
- "Monetize" "package" "service offering" "client"
- "First-mover advantage" "emerging market" "opportunity window"
- "Builder" "architect" "creator" — identity-level language

**Sentence Rhythm:** Mix visionary statements with grounding specifics. "The AI consulting market is expanding fast. Here's exactly how to position yourself in it — starting this week." Alternate between inspiration and instruction.

## Universal Voice Rules (All ICPs, All Properties)

1. **Never condescend.** Every person reading our content is capable. Our job is to show them the path, not doubt their ability.
2. **Always be actionable.** Every piece of content should leave the audience with something they can DO. Motivation without action is wasted.
3. **Show proof.** Claims require evidence: screenshots, metrics, examples, stories. "Trust me" is never sufficient.
4. **One audience per piece.** Write to ONE person. Even "All ICP" content should have a primary voice — don't try to serve everyone equally in every sentence.
5. **Respect intelligence, bridge knowledge gaps.** Our audience is smart. They just haven't been exposed to this domain yet. Explain concepts without dumbing them down.
6. **Urgency without fear-mongering.** AI is moving fast and that creates real urgency. But we frame urgency as opportunity, not threat. "The window is open" not "You'll be left behind."
7. **Community over competition.** We build each other up. Even competitive-drive content for ICP 2 is framed as "be your best" not "beat everyone else."
