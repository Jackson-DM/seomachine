## Hook Selection Rules

1. **One hook per piece** — never stack multiple hooks
2. **Match ICP exactly** — ICP 1 hooks should never feel advanced; ICP 2 hooks should never feel basic
3. **Rotate categories** — in a batch, never use the same category twice in a row
4. **Adapt, don't copy** — use these as templates; swap the specific topic/tool/number to keep content fresh
5. **Test the scroll-stop** — read the hook and ask: would I stop scrolling for this?
