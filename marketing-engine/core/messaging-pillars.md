## Pillar Selection Guide

- **Monday/Saturday content** → Pillar 1 (Confidence) — targets ICP 1's emotional needs
- **Tuesday/Friday content** → Pillar 3 (Workflows) — targets ICP 2's practical needs
- **Wednesday/Sunday content** → Pillar 2 (Career Leverage) — targets ICP 3's transformation needs
- **Thursday content** → Pillar 4 (Mindset) — targets all ICPs, builds brand authority

## The Growth Formula

The fastest-performing structure for AI education content:

**Pain + Fast Win + Authority**

1. **Pain hook** — "If AI confuses you…"
2. **Fast solution** — show the workflow / prompt / result
3. **Authority close** — "This is how professionals do it"

Apply this structure across any pillar and any ICP. Adapt the pain, the solution complexity, and the authority framing to the target ICP.
