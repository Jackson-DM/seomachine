# AI Content Engine — Skill Installation & Usage Guide

## What This Is

The `ai-content-engine.skill` file is a Claude Agent Skill that turns Claude into your dedicated content strategist and writer for all three brand properties: **Houston AI Club**, **AI-First Work**, and **Amplify Intelligence**. Once installed, Claude will automatically reference your ICPs, hooks, messaging pillars, brand voice, and content format templates whenever you ask it to create content.

## How to Install

1. Go to **claude.ai** → **Settings** → **Skills** (or drag-and-drop into a conversation)
2. Upload the `ai-content-engine.skill` file
3. That's it — the skill is now active in all your conversations

## How to Use It

Just ask Claude to create content naturally. The skill triggers automatically when you mention content creation for your brands. Here are example prompts:

### Quick Content Requests

- **"Write 5 Instagram Reel hooks for ICP 1"**
- **"Create a LinkedIn post about AI workflows for ICP 2"**
- **"Draft a carousel about AI career paths for ICP 3"**
- **"Write a Reel script about prompting basics for beginners"**
- **"Create a newsletter issue about this week's AI workflow tip"**

### Batch Content

- **"Build a full week of content for all three ICPs"**
- **"Give me Monday through Friday content for Houston AI Club's Instagram"**
- **"Create 10 carousel ideas split across all three ICPs"**

### Strategic Content

- **"Write a 5-email welcome sequence for new AI-First Work subscribers"**
- **"Draft a blog post targeting 'how to start learning AI' for SEO"**
- **"Create a YouTube script about building an AI portfolio for ICP 3"**

### Content Repurposing

- **"Turn this LinkedIn post into a Reel script and a carousel"**
- **"Adapt this ICP 2 workflow tutorial for ICP 1 beginners"**
- **"Take this blog post and create 5 social posts from it"**

## What Claude Will Do Automatically

When the skill is active, Claude will:

1. **Identify the target ICP** from your request (or ask if ambiguous)
2. **Pull the right hooks** from the built-in hook bank
3. **Apply the correct voice and tone** for the target ICP and brand property
4. **Structure content** using the proven format templates
5. **Include metadata** (ICP, platform, pillar, hook type, brand, CTA) with each piece
6. **Follow the Pain + Fast Win + Authority formula** that performs best in the AI education niche

## Skill Files Included

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `SKILL.md` | Main orchestration — workflow, quick-start, quality rules |
| `references/icp-profiles.md` | Full ICP 1, 2, 3 profiles with demographics, psychographics, pain points, goals, buying behavior |
| `references/hook-bank.md` | 60+ proven hooks organized by ICP and category |
| `references/messaging-pillars.md` | Four core pillars with ICP-specific expressions and the growth formula |
| `references/content-formats.md` | Templates for Reels, carousels, LinkedIn, YouTube, email, blog, newsletter + weekly calendar |
| `references/brand-voice.md` | Tone, vocabulary, style rules per ICP and per brand property |

## Tips for Best Results

- **Be specific about the ICP** — "Write for ICP 2" or "targeting intermediate professionals" gives better results than a vague ask
- **Name the platform** — "for LinkedIn" vs "for TikTok" changes the structure, length, and tone significantly
- **Reference the format** — "carousel," "Reel script," "email sequence" triggers the right template
- **Ask for batches** — Claude handles "give me 5 variations" better than asking one at a time
- **Request metadata** — Ask Claude to tag each piece so you can track ICP/pillar balance
