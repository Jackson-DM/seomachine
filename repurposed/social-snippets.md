## Social Media Snippets

### Snippet 1
While 73% of small businesses express interest in AI, most struggle to implement it successfully on their own. The AI landscape is complex, fast-moving, and full of options that may or may not fit your specific situation.

### Snippet 2
AI consulting for small businesses typically ranges from $2,000 to $15,000, depending on scope of work, business size, industry requirements, and consultant experience. Many consultants offer flexible packages from initial assessments to comprehensive transformation projects.

### Snippet 3
If AI consulting costs $5,000 and saves your team 10 hours per week valued at $50 per hour, you've recouped your investment in just 10 weeks. After that, it's pure profit.

### Snippet 4
Without expert guidance, small business owners often get overwhelmed by thousands of AI tool options, choose solutions that don't fit their workflow, underestimate implementation time, and miss ROI because they lack a clear strategy.

### Snippet 5
AI consulting typically helps small businesses grow without proportionally increasing headcount. Instead of replacing people, AI frees your team to focus on high-value work like building relationships and strategic planning while AI handles repetitive tasks.

### Snippet 6
If you have repetitive tasks, customer inquiries, or data to analyze, you're not too small for AI consulting. Some businesses with as few as 5 employees see significant benefits. The key is finding a consultant who understands small business constraints.

### Snippet 7
AI-powered chatbots can handle common questions, schedule appointments, and route complex issues to your team even at 2 AM. One local service business reduced response time from 4 hours to under 2 minutes, leading to a 35% increase in customer satisfaction.

### Snippet 8
When choosing an AI consultant, look for small business experience, industry knowledge, proven results, clear communication, and a flexible approach. Avoid consultants who push expensive solutions without understanding your needs or promise unrealistic instant results.

### Snippet 9
AI consulting helps you turn your data into actionable insights, knowing exactly which products sell best, which marketing channels drive results, and where to invest resources. It levels the playing field by giving you access to the same powerful tools larger competitors use without the enterprise price tag.

### Snippet 10
Most small businesses see AI consulting ROI within 3 to 6 months. You'll start seeing efficiency gains in months 3-4, and cost savings and revenue increases become measurable by months 5-6. After that, ongoing benefits compound as your team becomes more AI-proficient.
