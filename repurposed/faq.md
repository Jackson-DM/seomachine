Frequently Asked Questions
Q: What is AI consulting for small businesses?
A: It’s professional guidance to identify, implement, and optimize AI solutions that fit your needs and budget. A consultant finds high-impact opportunities, recommends tools, guides implementation, and trains your team so AI keeps working after they leave.
Q: How is AI consulting different from traditional IT consulting?
A: IT consulting maintains infrastructure, while AI consulting focuses on automation and data-driven decisions. The goal is to change how you operate—like automating tasks and improving ROI—rather than just keeping systems running.
Q: How much does AI consulting cost for small businesses?
A: Typical packages range from about $2,000 to $15,000, depending on scope, complexity, industry, and the consultant’s experience. Many firms offer flexible options, from quick assessments to full implementation.
Q: What ROI should I expect, and how fast?
A: Many small businesses see measurable ROI in 3–6 months through time savings, cost avoidance, and revenue gains. A $5,000 project that saves 10 hours a week at $50/hour can pay for itself in roughly 10 weeks.
Q: Is my business too small for AI consulting?
A: Probably not. If you have repetitive tasks, customer inquiries, or data to analyze, AI can help—even with just a few employees. The key is a consultant who understands small business constraints.
Q: Will AI consulting lead to job losses?
A: It’s usually the opposite. AI takes on repetitive work so your team can focus on higher-value tasks like serving customers and growing the business.
Q: Do I need an AI consultant or just AI tools?
A: If you already know which tools you need and how to implement them, you might DIY. If you’re unsure where to start, a consultant can save time and prevent costly missteps.
Q: What should I look for in a small business AI consultant?
A: Look for small business and industry experience, clear communication, proven results, and flexibility. Ask for case studies, what’s included, how success is measured, and what happens after the engagement.
Q: What are red flags when choosing an AI consultant?
A: Be cautious if they push expensive solutions without understanding your needs, can’t explain things simply, lack small business experience, or promise instant, unrealistic results.
Q: What does a typical AI consulting process include?
A: Expect an assessment of your business, a tailored AI strategy with priorities and timelines, implementation planning with clear roles, and training plus handoff so your team can run the solutions. Ongoing support should be available if you need it.
