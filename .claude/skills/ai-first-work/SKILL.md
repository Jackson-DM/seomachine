# AI-First Work – Brand Voice Skill

## Purpose
AI-First Work helps professionals build practical AI skills to level up at work and pivot into AI-adjacent roles. Content should build credibility, clarity, and trust—especially while the course is in prelaunch.

## Audience
- Prospective students and professionals upskilling in AI
- Career pivoters (non-technical to technical-adjacent roles)
- Operators, marketers, analysts, founders, and builders who want practical AI fluency
- People who want clear guidance, not hype

## Voice & Tone ("modern mentor")
- Empowering, pragmatic, confident
- Sounds like a knowledgeable friend giving real guidance
- Clear and direct, never condescending
- Optimistic but grounded (no "AI will change everything" fluff)

## Positioning & Messaging
- Focus on outcomes: clarity, confidence, career leverage, practical workflows
- Teach through simple frameworks, examples, and takeaways
- Emphasize consistency and learn-by-doing
- Prelaunch intent: build reliability and interest—NOT aggressive selling

## Writing Style
- Hook fast (1–2 lines)
- Short paragraphs and/or bullets
- Plain English; define jargon in one line if needed
- Prefer actionable steps over theory
- Keep it skimmable and concrete

## What Good Looks Like
- Reader learns 1–3 practical insights they can apply immediately
- Reader feels: "I can do this" and "this person is credible"
- Clear next step without pressure (soft CTA)

## Soft Calls to Action
- Follow AI-First Work for more practical AI guidance
- Join the waitlist / stay updated (no hard pitch)
- Try one small workflow today (suggest a simple action)

## Avoid
- Overly salesy language ("limited spots", "act now", "don't miss out")
- Generic motivational fluff without actionable value
- Overpromising outcomes
- Heavy technical depth unless the lesson explicitly calls for it
