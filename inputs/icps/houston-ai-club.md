# Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

## ICP Name
Houston AI Club – Practitioner / Builder

## Who This Is
A working professional or builder who is curious about AI and wants practical, real-world insight. They may not work in AI full-time but are actively experimenting, learning, or attending events to stay current.

## Primary Goals
- Learn how AI is actually being used in practice
- Improve effectiveness at work
- Connect with others in the local AI ecosystem

## Primary Frustrations
- Hype-heavy AI content with no substance
- Overly abstract or academic explanations
- Salesy posts pretending to be educational

## Knowledge Level
Intermediate. Familiar with AI tools and concepts, but not an expert. Comfortable experimenting but still learning what works.

## What Makes Them Stop Scrolling
- Concrete examples from real workflows
- Tool comparisons grounded in use cases
- Insights that feel learned, not generated

## What Turns Them Off
- Generic listicles
- Overconfident predictions
- "AI will replace everything" framing

## Content They Respect
- Practical lessons from real experiments
- Honest tradeoffs between tools
- Clear explanations without jargon

## Desired Action
