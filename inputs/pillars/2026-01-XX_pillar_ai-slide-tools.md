Pillar Theme: Learn-by-Doing tactical AI use cases
Topic: Choosing the right AI slide tool based on workflow, not hype
Audience: Professionals experimenting with AI tools at work
Tone Notes: Practical, grounded, no tool evangelism

## Core Idea
AI slide tools aren't interchangeable. The real skill isn't using AI for slides—it's knowing which tool fits your workflow, time constraints, and output needs. Choosing the wrong tool often creates more friction than value.

## Key Points
- Different tools optimize for different outcomes (speed, polish, scale)
- Visual quality matters less than clarity in most internal decks
- Parallel generation can speed up ideation dramatically
- Code-driven tools shine when you need repeatability
- Picking tools intentionally saves more time than perfecting prompts

## Example / Scenario
A team testing multiple slide tools in parallel can compare outputs in minutes instead of overthinking a single option.
