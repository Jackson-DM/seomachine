# Houston AI Club – Lightning Lesson
Date: January 2026
Session Title: AI Slide Creation Tools Comparison
Speaker(s): Leon Coe

## TL;DR
- Four main AI slide tools compared: Gamma, Nano Banana Pro, Claude, and SlideV—each with distinct strengths
- Gamma ($20/month) offers the best PowerPoint-like editing and brand consistency
- Nano Banana Pro and NotebookLM are free via Google, ideal for quick visual slides
- SlideV and Claude suit power users needing scalable, code-driven slide generation
- AI can evaluate existing decks on multiple criteria and suggest specific improvements

## Key Takeaways
- Gamma targets business users wanting a "PowerPoint 2.0" experience with visual editing and brand consistency
- Nano Banana Pro (part of Google Gemini) generates visually rich slides as images but lacks easy editing
- SlideV is open source, exports to PDF/PowerPoint, and supports markdown-like syntax for mass slide production
- Claude enables content-first, code-driven slides exportable as PowerPoint or HTML
- Generate multiple presentations in parallel (e.g., run Nano Banana Pro 3-4 times over 5-10 minutes) to quickly compare options
- Use AI to score your existing deck on 7 criteria (1-10), then apply recommended improvements automatically
- Brand consistency is valuable but can be deprioritized if the message is clear—balance aesthetics with time spent
- Security varies: Google tools align with enterprise standards; Gamma follows typical startup security practices
- Corporate AI policies are expected to loosen over the next 6-12 months
- Pick your tool based on your priority: visual polish (Gamma), speed and visuals (Nano Banana Pro), or scalability (SlideV/Claude)
