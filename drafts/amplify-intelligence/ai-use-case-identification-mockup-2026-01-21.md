# The One Question That Separates Good AI Investments from Wasted Ones

## Overview

**Topic**: A practical framework for identifying genuine AI opportunities versus hype-driven initiatives that won't deliver value.

**Angle**: Reframe AI from "technology to implement" to "prediction capability to deploy"—and use that reframe to filter opportunities ruthlessly.

**Target Audience**: Executives and senior leaders facing pressure to "do something with AI" who want to invest wisely, not chase trends.

**Primary Value**: Readers will gain a simple but powerful filtering question and a framework for evaluating whether AI is the right solution for any given business problem.

## Proposed Outline

### Introduction
- Hook: "'We need to do something with AI.' I hear this from executives every week. My response is always the same question—and it stops most AI projects in their tracks."
- Problem/Context: The pressure to adopt AI is intense, but most organizations lack a framework for identifying where AI will actually deliver value versus where it's innovation theater.
- Promise: This article provides a single filtering question and a decision framework that separates high-ROI AI investments from costly distractions.

### Section 1: The Question That Changes Everything
- Key point: "What decision would you make differently if you had better predictions?" cuts through AI hype instantly.
- Supporting content:
  - Why this question works (AI = prediction at scale)
  - How to apply the question in executive conversations
  - Examples of answers that indicate genuine AI opportunities
  - Examples of answers that indicate AI isn't the solution
- Takeaway: If you can't name a specific decision that would improve with better prediction, you don't need AI.

### Section 2: AI Is Prediction—Understanding the Core Capability
- Key point: Demystifying AI as fundamentally a prediction engine helps leaders evaluate opportunities clearly.
- Supporting content:
  - What AI actually does (pattern recognition, prediction at scale)
  - The types of predictions AI excels at (churn, conversion, demand, fraud, etc.)
  - What AI doesn't do well (novel situations, causal reasoning, judgment)
  - How to match prediction capabilities to business needs
- Takeaway: Understanding AI's actual capabilities prevents both over-investment and missed opportunities.

### Section 3: When AI Is the Wrong Answer
- Key point: Many problems labeled as "AI opportunities" are actually data, process, or reporting problems.
- Supporting content:
  - Signs you need better data hygiene, not AI
  - Signs you need process improvement, not AI
  - Signs you need dashboards/BI, not AI
  - The cost of misdiagnosis (wasted investment, delayed real solutions)
- Takeaway: Not every problem is an AI problem—and correctly diagnosing non-AI problems saves millions.

### Section 4: The AI Opportunity Evaluation Framework
- Key point: A structured approach to evaluating potential AI use cases increases investment success rates.
- Supporting content:
  - Decision tree for AI opportunity evaluation
  - Criteria: decision impact, prediction feasibility, data availability, action capability
  - Scoring model for prioritizing opportunities
  - Red flags that disqualify use cases
- Takeaway: Systematic evaluation beats intuition when selecting AI investments.

### Section 5: Industry Examples—Where AI Delivers Real Value
- Key point: Concrete examples illustrate where the prediction framework identifies genuine opportunities.
- Supporting content:
  - Financial services: Fraud detection, credit scoring, churn prediction
  - Healthcare: Diagnostic support, readmission risk, resource optimization
  - Retail: Demand forecasting, personalization, inventory optimization
  - Manufacturing: Predictive maintenance, quality control, supply chain
- Takeaway: The highest-value AI use cases share common characteristics that the framework identifies.

### Section 6: From Question to Action—Starting the Right AI Project
- Key point: Once a genuine opportunity is identified, starting correctly sets up long-term success.
- Supporting content:
  - Defining success metrics tied to the decision being improved
  - Scoping the minimum viable prediction
  - Building the feedback loop (prediction → decision → outcome → learning)
  - Organizational readiness requirements
- Takeaway: Starting with the decision ensures AI delivers measurable business value.

### Conclusion
- Key takeaways:
  1. "What decision would you make differently with better predictions?" is the essential filtering question
  2. AI is prediction at scale—understanding this clarifies where it adds value
  3. Many "AI opportunities" are actually data, process, or reporting problems
  4. A structured evaluation framework beats intuition for AI investment decisions
  5. Starting with the decision (not the technology) ensures business value
- Call to action: Apply the filtering question to your current AI initiatives; schedule a strategy session to evaluate your AI opportunity pipeline
- Closing thought: "The best AI investments start with a decision that matters, then work backward to the prediction that would help."
