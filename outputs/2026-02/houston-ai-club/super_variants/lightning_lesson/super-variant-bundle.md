## Variant 1: LinkedIn Post (Founder, Strategic)

**Hook:**

Brand consistency might be overrated.

**Body:**

At our last Houston AI Club meetup, Leon Coe said something that stuck with me: if the message is clear, obsessing over slide aesthetics is where most people waste their time.

He walked through four AI slide tools, and the real lesson wasn't which one is "best." It's that each one solves a different problem -- and most people pick wrong because they never define theirs.

Here's the breakdown:

- Gamma ($20/mo) -- best for brand-controlled decks where you need PowerPoint-style editing after generation
- Claude -- content-first, code-driven, exports to PowerPoint. Best when your slides need to say something precise
- SlideV -- open source, markdown syntax, exports to PDF and PowerPoint. Built for scale
- Nano Banana Pro -- free through Google. Fire it off 3-4 times, compare outputs, pick the strongest

The honest tradeoff: if you're producing 50 decks for a training program, SlideV wins. If you're building one deck for a board meeting, Gamma or Claude wins. Those are different tools for different jobs, and treating them the same is the mistake.

What shifted my thinking is that the bottleneck in AI slide creation isn't the AI. It's the human decision-making layer -- knowing what "good" looks like before you start generating.

**CTA:**

We dig into real tool comparisons like this at every Houston AI Club meetup. What's the one AI tool you've tried for slides that actually stuck? Drop it in the comments -- genuinely curious what's working for people.

**Brand Alignment Self-Score:** 8/10
This variant uses a contrarian, honest-tradeoff framing that matches the ICP's preference for earned opinions. It names specific tools with pricing and use cases, avoids hype language, and closes with a community-oriented CTA that invites genuine conversation. Slightly less "warm community builder" energy than peak brand voice, leaning a touch more founder-analytical.

## Variant 2: LinkedIn Post (Operator, Tactical)

**Hook:**

Your slides are done. But something feels off -- and you can't pinpoint why.

**Body:**

Leon Coe showed us a workflow at Houston AI Club that I've used three times since.

Step 1: Generate your deck in any AI tool (Nano Banana Pro is free through Google -- I run it 3-4 times over 5-10 minutes and compare the outputs).

Step 2: Upload your best draft to Claude. Ask it to score each slide on 7 criteria, 1-10. Things like clarity, visual hierarchy, message alignment, audience fit.

Step 3: Read the scores. Claude will flag exactly where slides fall flat and give you specific revision suggestions -- not vague "make it better" advice, but pointed fixes.

Step 4: Apply the changes and re-score. You'll see the numbers move.

This works because most of us can feel when a deck isn't right but can't articulate why. The scoring workflow gives you a diagnostic instead of a gut feeling. It turns revision from a guessing game into a checklist.

One thing Leon was honest about: if you're producing slides at scale (think training materials, course content), skip the manual polish loop. Use SlideV -- it's open source, runs on markdown-like syntax, and exports to PDF and PowerPoint. The tradeoff is less visual control, but at volume, that's the right tradeoff.

**CTA:**

Next time you finish a deck and something feels off, try the 7-criteria scoring method before you start tweaking randomly. If you want to see Leon walk through this live, our Houston AI Club meetups cover workflows like this every month -- check the link in our bio for the next one.

**Brand Alignment Self-Score:** 9/10
This variant directly preserves the highest-scoring element from the evaluation (Variant 5's scoring workflow) with a relatable problem hook. The step-by-step format is practitioner-earned, not listicle-formatted. The CTA references the next meetup with a specific reason to attend. Warm, practical, and welcoming to all skill levels.

## Variant 3: SEO Blog Outline + Intro (Strategic)

**Target Keyword:** AI slide creation tools comparison 2026

**Title:** Which AI Slide Tool Actually Fits Your Workflow? A Practitioner's Comparison of Gamma, Claude, SlideV, and Nano Banana Pro

### Intro

Most comparisons of AI slide tools line up features in a table and call it a day. But the real question isn't which tool has more features -- it's which tool matches the way you actually work.

At a recent Houston AI Club meetup, Leon Coe broke down four AI slide creation tools by walking through real workflows with each one. Not demos. Not feature lists. Actual use cases with honest tradeoffs.

This post captures those lessons: what each tool does well, where each one falls short, and a practical workflow for evaluating any AI-generated deck before you present it.

### Outline

**H2: The Problem With Picking an AI Slide Tool**
- Most people default to whatever's popular or free
- The real variable: what kind of deck are you making, how many, and for whom?
- Scale production vs. executive presentation vs. quick internal deck -- three different problems, three different answers

**H2: Four Tools, Four Different Strengths**

- **H3: Gamma ($20/mo) -- Best for Brand-Controlled Decks**
  - PowerPoint-style editing after generation
  - Visual controls for brand consistency
  - Best fit: teams that need polished, on-brand output with manual refinement

- **H3: Nano Banana Pro (Free via Google) -- Best for Fast Iteration**
  - Run it 3-4 times in parallel over 5-10 minutes
  - Compare outputs, pick the strongest draft
  - Best fit: quick internal decks, early-stage brainstorming

- **H3: SlideV (Open Source) -- Best for Scale Production**
  - Markdown-like syntax, exports to PDF and PowerPoint
  - Programmatic generation when you need 20+ decks
  - Best fit: training programs, course content, curriculum slides
  - Honest tradeoff: less visual polish, more output volume

- **H3: Claude -- Best for Content-First, Precision Decks**
  - Code-driven slide generation, exports to PowerPoint
  - Strength is in the content layer, not the visual layer
  - Best fit: when the message matters more than the design

**H2: The 7-Criteria Scoring Workflow**
- Upload any AI-generated deck to Claude
- Ask it to score each slide on 7 criteria (1-10): clarity, visual hierarchy, message alignment, audience fit, flow, completeness, and specificity
- Review the scores, apply the recommended changes, re-score
- Why this works: replaces gut-feel revision with a diagnostic checklist
- Works regardless of which tool generated the original deck

**H2: The Real Bottleneck Isn't AI**
- Generation is fast -- the constraint is human decision-making
- Knowing what "good" looks like before you generate saves more time than switching tools
- Define your context first (audience, volume, stakes), then pick the tool

**H2: Choosing Based on Your Context**
- Decision framework: scale vs. polish vs. speed
- Quick reference table mapping use case to recommended tool
- When to combine tools (e.g., generate in Nano Banana Pro, evaluate in Claude, finalize in Gamma)

**Brand Alignment Self-Score:** 8/10
The blog outline preserves the evaluation's strongest elements -- actionable workflows, specific tool details with pricing, and honest tradeoff framing. It avoids listicle energy by organizing around use cases and decisions rather than a numbered ranking. The tone is practitioner-first and the CTA ties back to the community. Slightly less conversational than peak Houston AI Club voice due to the SEO blog format, but the intro and CTA maintain warmth.

## Variant 4: Email Newsletter Draft (Tactical)

**Subject Line:** The slide scoring trick I keep coming back to

**Preview Text:** Plus a clean breakdown of which AI slide tool fits which workflow

---

Hey everyone,

Quick one from our last meetup that I keep coming back to.

Leon Coe walked us through four AI slide tools, and the part I've actually used since is dead simple:

**Upload your finished deck to Claude. Ask it to score every slide on 7 criteria, 1-10.**

Clarity. Visual hierarchy. Message alignment. Audience fit. Flow. Completeness. Specificity.

You get a scorecard with specific recommendations -- not "this slide needs work" but "slide 4 scores 3/10 on clarity because the headline contradicts the supporting data." Then you fix the flagged slides and re-score.

I've done this three times now. Every time, it catches things I missed and turns vague "this feels off" into concrete fixes.

**The quick tool breakdown from Leon's session:**

| Tool | Cost | Best For |
|------|------|----------|
| Gamma | $20/mo | Brand-controlled decks, PowerPoint-style editing post-generation |
| Nano Banana Pro | Free (Google) | Quick drafts -- run it 3-4 times, compare, pick the best |
| SlideV | Free (open source) | Scale production -- markdown syntax, PDF/PowerPoint export |
| Claude | Subscription | Content-first precision decks, code-driven generation |

The honest take: there's no single "best" tool. If you're producing 50 training decks, SlideV. If you're building a board deck, Gamma or Claude. The mistake is picking one tool for every job.

**One thing Leon said that stuck with me:** the bottleneck isn't AI generation speed. It's knowing what "good" looks like before you start. Define your audience, your stakes, and your volume first. Then pick the tool.

**What's coming up:**

Our next Houston AI Club meetup is on the calendar. We're keeping the same format -- practitioners sharing real workflows, not product demos. If the scoring trick or the tool breakdown was useful, the next session goes just as deep on a different topic.

Check our LinkedIn page for the date and details. Everyone's welcome, regardless of experience level.

Talk soon,
Houston AI Club
