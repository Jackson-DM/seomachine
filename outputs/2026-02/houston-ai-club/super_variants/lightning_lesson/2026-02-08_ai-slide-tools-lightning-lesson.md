## Strategy Snapshot (Auto)
- ICP: **ICP 2 — The AI-Curious Professional** — Houston AI Club's LinkedIn audience skews toward practitioners who already use AI and want workflow-level content. The source material (tool comparison + workflow tips) maps directly to their needs.
- Pillar: **Pillar 3 — Practical AI Workflows (Systems Over Tools)** — The source content is fundamentally about choosing and using AI slide tools as part of a real workflow, not just reviewing features.
- Hook style: **Contrarian / Relatable Problem** — The evaluation data shows Variant 3's contrarian hook (52/70) and Variant 5's relatable problem hook (55/70) scored highest with this ICP. These patterns earn attention without hype.
- CTA: Engagement-driven (comment prompt or next meetup reference) — the evaluation flagged generic "follow" CTAs as the weakest element across all variants.

## Variants

### Variant 1: LinkedIn (Founder/Strategic — Contrarian Take)
**Hook:**
Brand consistency might be overrated when you're building AI slides.

**Body:**
At our last Lightning Lesson, Leon Coe showed us four AI slide tools side by side.

The honest answer? None of them nail brand consistency yet. And for most use cases — internal decks, quick workshops, draft presentations — that's completely fine.

Here's the tradeoff nobody talks about:
- If you need polished, on-brand decks → stick with Gamma. Best design quality, $10/month.
- If you need to produce slides at scale for courses or workshops → SlidesGPT or SlideV. Less polish, more speed.
- If you want free and open source → SlideV. Markdown-based, exports to multiple formats.

The real question isn't "which tool is best." It's "what's the job this deck needs to do?"

Sometimes speed beats polish. And that's a feature, not a compromise.

**CTA:**
What's your current slide workflow? Curious what tools people here are actually using.

**Notes:**
- Target persona: ICP 2 — practitioner who values honest tradeoffs over hype
- Style: Opinionated but grounded. No overselling. Feels like a real person sharing a real take from a real session.

### Variant 2: LinkedIn (Tactical/How-to — Relatable Problem)
**Hook:**
Your AI slides are done. But something feels off.

**Body:**
Here's a quick evaluation workflow we picked up from Leon Coe's Lightning Lesson at Houston AI Club:

Score your AI-generated slides on 7 criteria, 1–10:
1. Visual clarity — can someone parse each slide in 5 seconds?
2. Content accuracy — did the AI hallucinate anything?
3. Flow — does the narrative build logically?
4. Brand fit — does it look like it came from your org?
5. Audience match — right depth for who's receiving it?
6. CTA clarity — does the deck drive a next step?
7. Edit time — how long to get from AI output to "send-ready"?

If your total is under 50, switch tools.
If it's 50–60, refine your prompts.
If it's 60+, you've found your workflow.

This one framework saves more time than any tool comparison.

**CTA:**
Save this for your next deck review. And if you've got a scoring method that works better — drop it in the comments.

**Notes:**
- Target persona: ICP 2 — workflow-oriented, wants something they can use immediately
- Style: Step-by-step, practical, zero fluff. The kind of post people screenshot.

### Variant 3: X Thread (7 tweets — Tool Comparison)
**Hook:**
I watched someone demo 4 AI slide tools in 30 minutes. Here's what actually matters when picking one:

**Body:**

🧵 1/7
Most AI slide tool comparisons focus on features. But the real differentiator is the job the deck needs to do. A thread from Houston AI Club's Lightning Lesson with Leon Coe.

2/7
**Gamma** ($10/mo) — Best for client-facing and polished decks. Strongest design engine. If your slides need to look like a designer touched them, start here.

3/7
**SlidesGPT** (pay-per-deck) — Best for speed and volume. Generate a full deck from a prompt. Good for internal presentations, brainstorms, and drafts you'll refine.

4/7
**SlideV** (free, open source) — Best for educators, course creators, and anyone producing slides at scale. Markdown-based. Exports to PDF, PPTX, HTML. No lock-in.

5/7
**Plus AI** (Google Slides add-on) — Best if you live in Google Workspace. Generates directly inside Slides. Familiar interface, lower learning curve.

6/7
The honest take: none of them handle brand consistency well yet. If you need pixel-perfect brand decks, you're still editing manually. But for 80% of slide work? These tools cut hours.

7/7
Pick based on the job, not the hype. And if you're in Houston — we break down tools like this every month at Houston AI Club. Come see for yourself.

**CTA:**
(Tweet 7 serves as CTA — invites to Houston AI Club)

**Notes:**
- Target persona: ICP 2, secondary ICP 1 — accessible comparison format
- Style: Concise, one insight per tweet, no filler. Each tweet should stand alone if quoted.

### Variant 4: Short-Form Script (45 seconds — Relatable Problem)
**Hook:**
"You ever spend 20 minutes fixing an AI-generated slide deck... and realize you could've built it faster from scratch?"

**Body:**
[Face to camera]
"Yeah. That was me. Until I learned a simple scoring trick from a Houston AI Club session.

[Text overlay: SCORE YOUR AI SLIDES 1–10]
Before you start editing, score the deck on three things:
- Visual clarity
- Content accuracy
- Edit time needed

[Text overlay: UNDER 5? SWITCH TOOLS.]
If any score is under 5 — don't fix it. Switch tools.

[Text overlay: OVER 7? YOU FOUND YOUR WORKFLOW.]
If everything's above 7, you've found your workflow. Stop tool-hopping.

[Back to face]
This one check saves me hours every week."

**CTA:**
"Save this. Next time your AI deck feels off, score it first."

**Notes:**
- Target persona: ICP 2 with ICP 1 accessibility — visual, quick, actionable
- Style: Conversational, practical, feels like a friend sharing a tip. No hype.
- Length: ~40 seconds

### Variant 5: Email (Short — Session Recap)
**Hook:**
Subject: The slide tool question nobody asks

**Body:**
Hey —

At this month's Lightning Lesson, Leon Coe demoed four AI slide tools back to back.

Everyone wanted the answer: "Which one is best?"

But the better question turned out to be: "What's the job this deck needs to do?"

Here's the quick breakdown:

→ **Polished, client-facing?** Gamma ($10/mo)
→ **Fast drafts at volume?** SlidesGPT (pay-per-deck)
→ **Course content at scale?** SlideV (free, open source)
→ **Google Workspace native?** Plus AI (Slides add-on)

Honest take: none of them handle brand consistency perfectly yet. But for internal decks, workshops, and drafts? They cut hours off the process.

One thing Leon shared that stuck with me — a 7-criteria scoring framework for evaluating your AI slide output. If you want the full breakdown, reply to this email and I'll send it over.

See you at the next one.

— Houston AI Club

**CTA:**
Reply for the full scoring framework.

**Notes:**
- Target persona: ICP 2 — existing community members who attended or missed the session
- Style: Warm, conversational, community-first. Matches Houston AI Club brand voice. The reply CTA drives engagement.

### Variant 6: LinkedIn (Comment Bait — Engagement Post)
**Hook:**
Genuine question for anyone using AI to build slide decks:

**Body:**
We demoed four tools at our last Houston AI Club session — Gamma, SlidesGPT, SlideV, and Plus AI.

Every single one had a gap.

Gamma = beautiful but pricey.
SlidesGPT = fast but rough.
SlideV = free but manual.
Plus AI = convenient but limited.

No clear winner. Just tradeoffs.

So I'm curious:

What's your current AI slide setup? Are you happy with it, or still looking?

**CTA:**
(Embedded — the question IS the CTA)

**Notes:**
- Target persona: ICP 2 — practitioners with opinions and experience to share
- Style: Honest, non-prescriptive, invites real conversation. Not a disguised pitch. The vulnerability of "no clear winner" builds trust.

---

### Variant 7: LinkedIn (Audience-Specific — Educators/Course Creators)
**Hook:**
If you're building slides for a course, tutorial, or curriculum — this tool might save you hours.

**Body:**
At Houston AI Club's Lightning Lesson, Leon Coe showed us SlideV — an open-source, markdown-based slide tool.

Why it matters for educators and course creators:
- Write slides in markdown (version control, easy editing)
- Export to PDF, PPTX, and HTML from one source
- Free — no per-deck fees, no subscription
- Customize themes without fighting a WYSIWYG editor

The tradeoff: it's not as polished as Gamma. You won't get designer-quality layouts out of the box.

But if you're producing 10, 20, 50+ decks for a course library? The speed and flexibility beat polish every time.

I've started using it for workshop decks and it's cut my prep time significantly.

**CTA:**
Anyone else using markdown-based slide tools? Would love to hear what workflows you've built around them.

**Notes:**
- Target persona: Subset of ICP 2 — educators, trainers, course builders
- Style: Specific, practical, honest about tradeoffs. Narrower audience but deeper resonance.

### Variant 8: Carousel Outline (LinkedIn/Instagram — Tool Decision Framework)
**Hook:**
Slide 1: "Which AI slide tool should you actually use?"

**Body:**
Slide 2: "It depends on ONE question: What's the job this deck needs to do?"

Slide 3: **Client deck?** → Gamma. Best design quality. $10/month. Your slides actually look designed.

Slide 4: **Fast internal draft?** → SlidesGPT. One prompt, full deck. Pay per use. Good enough for brainstorms and reviews.

Slide 5: **Course/workshop content?** → SlideV. Open source. Markdown-based. Export anywhere. Free.

Slide 6: **Google Workspace user?** → Plus AI. Works inside Slides. Familiar, fast, low friction.

Slide 7: **The honest gap:** None of them handle brand consistency well yet. If you need pixel-perfect brand decks, you're still editing.

Slide 8: **The real framework:** Stop comparing features. Start with the job. Pick the tool that matches.

Slide 9: "From Houston AI Club's Lightning Lesson with Leon Coe. We break down tools like this every month."

Slide 10: CTA — "Save this for your next deck decision. Follow Houston AI Club for practical AI breakdowns."

**CTA:**
Save this post.

**Notes:**
- Target persona: ICP 2 primary, ICP 1 secondary — visual learners, scannable format
- Style: Clean, one insight per slide, decision-framework structure. High save potential.
