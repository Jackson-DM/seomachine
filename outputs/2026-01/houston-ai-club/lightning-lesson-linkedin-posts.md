# LinkedIn Posts – AI Slide Creation Tools (Houston AI Club Lightning Lesson)

## Variant 1 – Insight Hook

Most people pick an AI slide tool based on hype. Here's a better framework.

At our latest Houston AI Club session, Leon Coe broke down four major options:

- Gamma ($20/mo): Best for brand consistency and PowerPoint-style editing
- Nano Banana Pro: Free via Google, great for quick visuals
- SlideV: Open source, ideal for generating slides at scale
- Claude: Content-first, code-driven, exports to PowerPoint

The real question isn't "which is best?"

It's: What do you actually need?

- Visual polish? Gamma
- Speed and visuals? Nano Banana Pro
- Scalability? SlideV or Claude

Pick the tool that matches your workflow—not the one with the best marketing.

## Variant 2 – Question Hook

What if you could generate 4 slide decks in the time it takes to make one?

That's exactly what Leon Coe showed us at Houston AI Club.

The trick: Run multiple AI slide tools in parallel.

Fire off Nano Banana Pro 3-4 times over 5-10 minutes. Compare results. Pick the best.

No waiting. No sequential slowdowns.

This works because AI slide generation is fast—your bottleneck is decision-making, not creation.

A few other takeaways:

- Gamma offers the best editing experience post-generation
- SlideV is open source and built for mass production
- Claude works well for content-first, code-driven slides

The landscape is evolving fast. The people who experiment now will have a serious edge.

## Variant 3 – Contrarian Hook

Brand consistency in slides might be overrated.

That was one of the more honest admissions from Leon Coe at Houston AI Club.

His take: If the message is clear, obsessing over perfect aesthetics can waste time.

That doesn't mean design doesn't matter. It means priorities matter more.

If you're producing slides at scale—curriculum, tutorials, content—speed wins.

Tools like SlideV and Claude let you generate hundreds of slides programmatically.

If you're presenting to executives or clients, Gamma's visual editor and brand controls make sense.

Know your context. Choose accordingly.

## Variant 4 – Myth-Busting Hook

"AI slide tools are all the same."

Not even close.

At Houston AI Club, Leon Coe compared four options:

Gamma: PowerPoint 2.0 with a visual editor and brand controls. $20/month.

Nano Banana Pro: Part of Google Gemini. Free. Generates beautiful slides as images. Limited editing.

SlideV: Open source. Markdown-like syntax. Built for educators and content creators producing at scale.

Claude: Code-driven. Content-first. Exports to PowerPoint or HTML.

Each tool serves a different user profile.

The mistake is picking one without knowing what you actually need.

## Variant 5 – Practical Problem Hook

Your slides are done. But something feels off.

Instead of manually tweaking each one, try this:

Upload your deck to Claude. Ask it to score the presentation on 7 criteria, 1-10.

Where scores are low, ask for specific recommendations.

Then apply the changes—either manually or with AI assistance.

This was one of the workflows Leon Coe shared at Houston AI Club.

It turns slide improvement from a guessing game into a structured process.

Other useful tips from the session:

- Generate multiple decks in parallel to compare options quickly
- Use Gamma for post-generation editing
- Use SlideV for high-volume, code-based production

## Variant 6 – Security Angle Hook

Before you pitch an AI slide tool at work, know the security landscape.

At Houston AI Club, Leon Coe broke it down:

- Nano Banana Pro and NotebookLM are Google products. Security aligns with Google's ecosystem.
- Gamma is a startup. Typical startup security—fine for most, but not enterprise-grade.
- SlideV and Claude are code-based tools. Your data stays local if you want it to.

His advice: Test tools on personal projects first. Build confidence. Then pitch internally.

Corporate AI policies are expected to loosen over the next 6-12 months.

The people experimenting now will be ready when that shift happens.

## Variant 8 – "What I Learned" Hook

I just learned something useful about AI slide tools.

At Houston AI Club, Leon Coe explained why generating slides in parallel beats doing it sequentially.

Here's the workflow:

Run Nano Banana Pro (or similar) 3-4 times simultaneously. Wait 5-10 minutes. Compare all the outputs.

You get variety. You save time. You make better choices.

This only works because AI generation is fast. The bottleneck is human decision-making.

Other takeaways:

- Gamma has the best editing experience
- SlideV is built for mass production
- AI can score your existing deck and suggest improvements

## Variant 9 – Audience-Specific Hook

If you're creating slides for a course, tutorial, or curriculum—read this.

Most AI slide tools are built for one-off business presentations.

But if you need 50, 100, or 500 slides?

SlideV is worth exploring.

It's open source. Uses markdown-like syntax. Exports to PDF and PowerPoint.

You trade off the visual editor for automation and speed.

At Houston AI Club, Leon Coe positioned it as the best option for content creators and educators who prioritize scale over polish.

Gamma and Nano Banana Pro are better for quick, visually appealing decks.

Know your use case. Pick the tool that fits.

## Variant 10 – Future-Focused Hook

What does this mean for you?

Experiment now. Build familiarity with multiple tools:

- Gamma for editing and brand control
- Nano Banana Pro for quick visuals
