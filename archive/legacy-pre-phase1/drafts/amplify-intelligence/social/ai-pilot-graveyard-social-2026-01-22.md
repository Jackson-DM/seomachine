# Social Posts: Why Most AI Pilots Never Make It to Production

## Key Messages Extracted

1. **Core Insight**: Most AI pilots fail for organizational reasons—no owner, integration underestimated, data quality glossed over, no maintenance plan, disconnected metrics—not technical ones.
2. **Supporting Point**: Treat the pilot as the START of the work, not the end. Assign production owners and budget for integration before the pilot begins.
3. **Supporting Point**: Demo success misleads. A successful POC is the beginning of the work, not validation that the work is done.
4. **Memorable Quote**: "Your AI pilot is impressive. But can it survive the journey from demo to production?"

### Variant 1

**Hook Type**: Story/Pattern Recognition
**Target Message**: Core Insight (five failure modes)

```
There's a graveyard at most Fortune 500 companies that nobody talks about.

It's filled with AI pilots—promising proofs of concept that delivered impressive demos but never made it to production.

After working on dozens of enterprise AI initiatives, I've seen the same pattern repeat:

1. No clear owner post-pilot
2. Integration complexity underestimated
3. Data quality issues glossed over in POC
4. No plan for model maintenance
5. Success metrics disconnected from business outcomes

The companies that break through? They treat the pilot as the START of the work, not the end.

They assign a production owner before the pilot begins.
They budget for integration as much as model development.
They define "what happens when this works" before writing a single line of code.

Your AI pilot is impressive.

But can it survive the journey from demo to production?

That's the only question that matters.

Where have you seen AI pilots stall out?

### Variant 2

**Hook Type**: Contrarian/Framework
**Target Message**: Supporting Point (production-first thinking)

```
Everyone celebrates the successful AI demo.

Almost nobody asks: "What happens when this works?"

Based on dozens of AI implementations, here's what separates pilots that reach production from those that don't:

Production-first thinking.

Before writing any code, successful teams answer three questions:

→ Who owns this in production? (Not the data science team)
→ How does this integrate with existing systems? (Budget for this)
→ What business outcome does this connect to? (Not model accuracy)

Most organizations optimize for pilot success.

The problem? Pilot success and production success require completely different conditions.

A controlled POC environment hides data quality issues.
Demo timelines ignore integration complexity.
Model performance metrics don't measure business impact.

The fix isn't better models.

It's better questions—asked before the pilot begins.

What's the hardest part of moving AI from pilot to production in your experience?

### Variant 1

**Hook Type**: Hard Truth
**Target Message**: Core Insight

```
Most AI pilots don't fail because of bad models.

They fail because nobody asked "who owns this in production?" before the demo.

5 things that actually kill pilots:
- No owner
- Integration underestimated
- Data quality glossed over
- No maintenance plan
- Metrics disconnected from outcomes

### Variant 2

**Hook Type**: Contrarian
**Target Message**: Production-first thinking

```
Stop celebrating successful AI demos.

Start asking: "What happens when this works?"

The companies that get AI to production treat the pilot as the START of the work, not the end.

## Brand Voice Checklist

- [x] Tone matches brand voice guidelines (consultative, expert, practical)
- [x] Platform-specific voice adaptations applied (LinkedIn fuller, Twitter punchy)
- [x] No forbidden phrases used
- [x] CTAs align with brand style (engagement-focused questions)
- [x] Hashtags from approved library

## Usage Recommendations

### Posting Sequence
1. **First**: LinkedIn Variant 1 (strongest, full story)
2. **24h later**: Twitter Variant 1 (compressed core insight)
3. **48h later**: LinkedIn Variant 2 (framework angle for different audience segment)

### A/B Testing
- Test LinkedIn Variant 1 (story hook) vs Variant 2 (contrarian hook) to compare engagement patterns
- Twitter variants serve different purposes: Variant 1 is list-based, Variant 2 is provocative one-liner

### Repurposing Notes
- LinkedIn Variant 1 could be adapted for a newsletter intro
- The "5 things that kill pilots" list works well as a carousel graphic
- "What happens when this works?" could become a recurring theme/series
