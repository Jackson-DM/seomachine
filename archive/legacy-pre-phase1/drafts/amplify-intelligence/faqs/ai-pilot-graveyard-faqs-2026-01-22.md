## Category 1: Understanding AI Pilot Failures

### Q: Why do most AI pilots fail to reach production?

**Short Answer**: Most AI pilots fail for organizational reasons, not technical ones. The five most common failure modes are: no clear owner post-pilot, underestimated integration complexity, data quality issues glossed over during POC, no plan for model maintenance, and success metrics disconnected from business outcomes.

**Expanded Answer**:
The pattern is remarkably consistent across organizations. A pilot delivers an impressive demo, leadership declares it a success, and then... nothing happens. The pilot sits in limbo, never making the transition to production deployment.

This happens because organizations optimize for pilot success rather than production success—two very different things. A controlled POC environment hides the challenges that only emerge at scale: messy real-world data, complex system integrations, and the ongoing maintenance every production model requires.

The companies that break through recognize that the demo is the beginning of the work, not the end. They plan for production from day one.

### Q: What is the AI pilot graveyard?

**Short Answer**: The AI pilot graveyard refers to the collection of promising AI proofs of concept at most large organizations that delivered successful demos but never made it to production deployment. These abandoned pilots represent wasted investment, often months of effort and significant resources with no business impact.

---

### Q: What's the difference between pilot success and production success?

**Short Answer**: Pilot success means the model works in a controlled environment with clean data and limited scope. Production success means the solution delivers measurable business value at scale, integrates with existing systems, handles real-world data quality issues, and can be maintained over time. Most organizations only optimize for the former.

**Expanded Answer**:
A successful pilot proves the technical feasibility of an approach. It shows that given clean data and controlled conditions, the model can perform the intended task. This is valuable information—but it's only the starting point.

Production success requires answering much harder questions: Who owns this system once the data science team moves on? How does it integrate with existing workflows? What happens when data quality degrades? How will you retrain the model as patterns change?

Organizations that conflate pilot success with production readiness end up with impressive demos that never deliver business value.

## Category 2: The Production-First Framework

### Q: What is a production-first framework for AI pilots?

**Short Answer**: A production-first framework means structuring every AI pilot as if it will go to production—because if it works, it should. This includes assigning a production owner before the pilot begins, defining "what happens when this works" upfront, budgeting for integration alongside model development, and connecting success metrics to business outcomes rather than model performance.

### Q: How do I assign ownership for an AI pilot?

**Short Answer**: Assign a production owner before the pilot begins, not after it succeeds. This person should come from the business unit that will use the solution, not the data science team. They're accountable for adoption, integration with existing workflows, and ongoing maintenance decisions. Without clear ownership, pilots stall in the handoff between technical teams and business operations.

**Expanded Answer**:
The ownership question is deceptively simple but consistently underestimated. During the pilot phase, the data science team naturally owns the work. But they're not the ones who will run this system in production—that's the business unit.

When you wait until after a successful pilot to figure out ownership, you create a dangerous gap. The data science team is ready to move on to the next project. The business unit wasn't involved in scoping and may not feel ownership. IT hasn't planned for the infrastructure. The result is a successful pilot with no home.

Assigning a production owner upfront changes the entire dynamic. That person participates in scoping, understands the tradeoffs, and is prepared to champion the transition to production.

### Q: What should I budget for beyond model development?

**Short Answer**: Budget as much for integration as you do for model development. Integration costs typically include: connecting to source data systems, building data pipelines for production data quality, integrating outputs with existing business workflows, developing monitoring and alerting systems, and creating retraining infrastructure. Organizations that only budget for the model itself consistently underestimate total project costs.

---

### Q: How do I define success metrics for an AI pilot?

**Short Answer**: Connect success metrics to business outcomes, not model performance. Instead of measuring model accuracy alone, measure the business decision the model improves—reduced customer churn, faster processing time, lower error rates, or increased revenue. If your metrics don't tie to outcomes stakeholders care about, a "successful" pilot won't generate organizational support for production deployment.

---

## Category 3: Pilot-to-Production Transition

### Q: Why do AI pilots stall after a successful demo?

**Short Answer**: Pilots stall because the demo marks the end of the planned work, not a milestone in a longer journey. Without explicit planning for the pilot-to-production transition—including dedicated resources, clear ownership, and integration budgets—momentum dies after the demo as the team moves to other priorities and the organization lacks a roadmap for what comes next.

---

### Q: What is a pre-pilot checklist for AI projects?

**Short Answer**: A pre-pilot checklist assesses production readiness before starting any pilot. Key questions include: Who will own this in production? How will it integrate with existing systems? What's the data quality in the production environment? How will the model be maintained and retrained? What business outcome will we measure? Answering these questions upfront prevents the most common pilot failures.

**Expanded Answer**:
The best time to prevent a failed pilot is before it starts. A pre-pilot checklist forces the difficult conversations early, when you can still adjust scope, secure resources, or decide not to proceed.

Red flags that predict pilot failure include: no clear business sponsor, vague success criteria, unknown production data quality, no integration plan, and assuming the data science team will maintain the model indefinitely.

Organizations with strong AI track records build this assessment into their project intake process. They'd rather say no to a promising idea without production viability than add another project to the graveyard.

---

### Q: When should I kill an AI pilot versus push through challenges?

**Short Answer**: Kill a pilot when the fundamental assumptions prove wrong—the data doesn't exist, the business process can't change, or the potential ROI no longer justifies the investment. Push through when challenges are execution problems rather than foundational issues: integration is harder than expected, data quality requires more cleaning, or the model needs more tuning. The key question is whether the original business case remains valid.
