# Session Log: 2026-01-21

## Goal

Implement a multi-brand social-to-blog workflow that:
1. Creates `context/brands/{brand-name}/` structure for multi-brand support
2. Adds `/generate-blogs` command as the workflow entrypoint
3. Reuses existing skills (`brand-voice`, `social-content`) and agents
4. Transforms social content sources into blog mockups with brand voice applied

**Workflow**: Social content sources → Topic extraction → Blog mockup generation → Brand voice application

---

## Decisions Made

### Brand Architecture
- Brand context lives under `context/brands/{brand-name}/`
- Each brand has two required files: `brand-voice.md` and `social-sources.md`
- Drafts output to `drafts/{brand-name}/` (gitignored, force-added for tracking)

### Placeholder Content
- Created two example brands with realistic placeholder content:
  - **Amplify Intelligence**: AI consulting company targeting enterprise leaders
  - **Houston AI Club**: Local AI community/meetup group
- Each brand has 5 social posts with engagement metrics and expansion potential ratings
- Brand voice files follow the Castos example template structure

### Mockup Format
- Mockups are outlines, not full content
- Include: overview, proposed outline, brand voice notes, expansion guidance, source material
- Naming convention: `[topic-slug]-mockup-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`

## Commands Run

```bash
# Phase 1: Verify structure after file creation
ls context/brands/amplify-intelligence
ls context/brands/houston-ai-club
ls .claude/commands | grep generate-blogs
ls drafts/amplify-intelligence
ls drafts/houston-ai-club

# Phase 2: Commit brand context foundation
git add .claude/commands/generate-blogs.md context/brands/
git add -f drafts/amplify-intelligence/.gitkeep drafts/houston-ai-club/.gitkeep
git commit -m "feat: add multi-brand social-to-blog workflow..."
git push

# Phase 3: Test generate-blogs command
/generate-blogs --brand amplify-intelligence --count 3
/generate-blogs --brand houston-ai-club --count 3

# Phase 4: Commit generated mockups
git add -f drafts/amplify-intelligence/*.md drafts/houston-ai-club/*.md
git commit -m "feat: generate blog mockups for both brands..."
git push
```

## How to Test

### Generate Blog Mockups

```bash
# Generate 3 mockups for Amplify Intelligence
/generate-blogs --brand amplify-intelligence --count 3

# Generate 3 mockups for Houston AI Club
/generate-blogs --brand houston-ai-club --count 3

# Generate with different count
/generate-blogs --brand amplify-intelligence --count 1
```

### Verify Output

```bash
# Check generated files
ls drafts/amplify-intelligence/
ls drafts/houston-ai-club/

# Read a mockup
cat drafts/amplify-intelligence/ai-pilot-graveyard-mockup-2026-01-21.md
```

### Expand Mockups (Next Step)

```bash
# Use write command to expand a mockup into full blog
/write [paste mockup content or reference]

# Apply brand voice review
/brand-voice review [draft file path]
```

## Notes

- Drafts directory is in `.gitignore` - use `git add -f` to track specific files
- Mockups use engagement metrics to prioritize topic selection (High > Medium-High > Medium)
- Brand voice files are comprehensive (~250 lines each) following Castos template
- Generate-blogs command validates brand exists before proceeding
